"After implant is put in, to achieve symmetry w/ native breast, should I have PS cut/move nipple or remove it during TE exchange?",13-Dec-13,,"I had a SNP sparing uni mastectomy; Tissue Expander exchange scheduled for 2014. We're trying to match the native (left) breast, PS said he might move the right nipple during the exchange surgery. Might be a chance he won't.

I haven't had radiation, and I don't smoke, so maybe the complication risks are slim.","After implant is put in, to achieve symmetry w/ native breast, should I have PS cut/move nipple or remove it during TE exchange?",Before Procedure Only,mastectomy
